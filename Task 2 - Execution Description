Employee Payroll Management System (SQL Project)

This project is a SQL-based Payroll Management System developed using PostgreSQL. It is designed to manage and analyze employee payroll data, including salary, bonuses, tax deductions, and departmental insights.

The database consists of a single but well-structured table:

    Employees: Stores employee information such as name, department, contact details, joining date, salary, bonus, and tax percentage.

What I've Done in This Project:

    Created and structured the employees table with appropriate data types and constraints.

    Inserted realistic sample data for 10 employees across multiple departments.

    Written SQL queries to:

        Retrieve a salary-wise sorted list of employees.

        Identify employees earning more than $100,000 in total compensation.

        Update bonus amounts for employees in the Sales department.

        Calculate net salary after tax deductions for all employees.

        Compute average, minimum, and maximum salary for each department.

        Find employees who joined within the last 6 months.

        Count the number of employees in each department.

        Identify the department with the highest average salary.

        Detect employees with matching salary values.
