###Employee Payroll Management System (SQL Project)

-This project is a SQL-based Payroll Management System developed using PostgreSQL. It is designed to manage employee records and analyze payroll data such as salaries, bonuses, tax deductions, and departmental performance.
-The database consists of one main table:

    **Employees**: Stores detailed information about employees including name, department, contact, joining date, salary, bonus, and tax percentage.

What I've Done in This Project:

    -Inserted 10 realistic employee records covering different departments.
    -Written SQL queries to:

        -Retrieve the list of employees sorted by salary in descending order.
        -Find employees with a total compensation (salary + bonus) greater than $100,000.
        -Update the bonus for employees in the 'Sales' department by 10%.
        -Calculate the net salary after tax deduction for each employee.
        -Retrieve average, minimum, and maximum salaries per department.
        -List employees who joined in the last 6 months.
        -Count the number of employees in each department.
       -Identify the department with the highest average salary.
        -Find employees who have the same salary as at least one other employee.
