# Employee Payroll System (SQL Project)

This project is a SQL-based **Employee Payroll System** designed to store, manage, and analyze salary-related data for employees within an organization. The system is built using MySQL and demonstrates the use of SQL for database design, data manipulation, and payroll analytics.

The database includes a single core table:

- **employees**: Stores employee details including name, department, contact information, joining date, salary, bonus, and tax percentage.

# What I've Done in This Project:

- Designed and created the `payroll_database` schema.
- Created the `employees` table with appropriate data types.
- Inserted 10 sample employee records.
- Written SQL queries to:
  - List employees sorted by salary in descending order.
  - Identify employees whose total compensation (salary + bonus) exceeds $100,000.
  - Apply a 10% bonus increase for employees in the Sales department.
  - Calculate net salary for each employee after tax deductions.
  - Retrieve average, minimum, and maximum salaries grouped by department.

# Advanced Analysis Included:

- Identified employees who joined within the last 6 months.
- Grouped employees by department and counted the number of employees per department.
- Found the department with the highest average salary.
- Retrieved employees who share the same salary with at least one other employee.
